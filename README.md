Created virtual environment, installed ipython,
installed and changed default editor to atom,
and added ann's original network code to bionets
directory. Setup and workflow should now be complete.

This is the initial commit for the bionets project
in which we look at neural network architectures
and training algorithms, both computationally and
biologically inspired, and compare their performance,
robustness, and error landscape characteristics 
under both infinite- and finite-time conditions, 
random and targeted attack, and degradation.
All code files for the git repo are included here.
All python packages and executables are incorporated
through the virtual environment in ../py_venvs/bionets/
