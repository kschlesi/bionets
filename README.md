...............
installed and began using pybrain package to
create arbitrarily deep networks with user-
defined connections. wrote pb_net.py to 
implement for feedforward networks. still to
do: implement training, node removal and re-
training.

...............
..25 Feb 2015..
...............
began work on attackable nets (building arch-
itecture) and programming FF/BP grad descent

...............
..midFeb 2015..
...............
changed all workflow to use anaconda and conda
environments (rather than virtualenv) in order
to obtain numpy/scipy on windows. this is now
complete on both computers. activate 'bionets'
env from windows cmd with '$activate bionets'.
created & trained simple hopfield ass. mem net.

...............
..11 Feb 2015..
...............
Created new python script for my neural network
code. Created class and thought about design.
Will leave more room for function definitions...

...............
..03 Feb 2015..
...............
Created virtual environment, installed ipython,
installed and changed default editor to atom,
and added ann's original network code to bionets
directory. Setup and workflow should now be complete.

This is the initial commit for the bionets project
in which we look at neural network architectures
and training algorithms, both computationally and
biologically inspired, and compare their performance,
robustness, and error landscape characteristics
under both infinite- and finite-time conditions,
random and targeted attack, and degradation.
All code files for the git repo are included here.
All python packages and executables are incorporated
through the virtual environment in ../py_venvs/bionets/
